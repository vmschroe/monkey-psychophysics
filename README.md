Model A: What is the relationship between amplitude of stimulus and discrimination task response?
- complete pooling over sessions
- 4 independent analyses for left/right hand, unimanual/bimanual trials
- covariates: stimulus strength

Model B: What is the relationship between amplitude of stimulus and discrimination task response?
- partial pooling over sessions
- 4 independent analyses for left/right hand, unimanual/bimanual trials
- covariates: stimulus strength

Model C: How does the strength of the distractor change it's impact?
- partial pooling over sessions
- 2 independent analyses for left/right hand
- covariates: stimulus strength, distractor strength
