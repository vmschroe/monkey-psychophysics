Model A: Pooled additive model 
- What is the relationship between amplitude of stimulus and discrimination task response?
- complete pooling over sessions
- includes lapse parameters
- 4 independent analyses for left/right hand, unimanual/bimanual trials 
    (data partitioned by hand and distraction status)
- covariates: stimulus strength
- logistic sigmoid

Model B: Hierarchical additive model
- What is the relationship between amplitude of stimulus and discrimination task response?
- partial pooling over sessions
- includes lapse parameters
- data partitioned by hand and distraction status
- covariates: stimulus strength
- logistic sigmoid

Model C: How does the strength of the distractor change it's impact?
- partial pooling over sessions
- 2 independent analyses for left/right hand
- covariates: stimulus strength, distractor strength

testing if it worked AGAIN
